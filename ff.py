JPMorganChase Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage - January 2026

 * Integrated Kafka into a Spring Boot microservice to consume and deserialize
   high-volume transaction messages using a configurable topic and embedded
   Kafka test framework.
 * Implemented transaction validation and persistence logic with Spring Data JPA
   and an H2 SQL database, including entity modeling and balance updates across
   relational User records.
 * Connected the service to an external REST Incentive API using RestTemplate,
   processing incentive responses and incorporating them into transactional
   workflows.
 * Developed a REST endpoint for querying user balances, returning JSON
   responses through a Spring controller while maintaining clean architectural
   boundaries.
 * Verified system behavior using Maven test suites and debugger-driven
   inspection, ensuring reliability across message ingestion, database
   operations, and external API interactions.

“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in JPMorganChase’s job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to
participate on a backend engineering team at JPMorganChase.
I worked on a project to build out key components of the Midas
transaction-processing system, integrating Kafka, a SQL database, and an
external REST API into a cohesive Spring Boot service. I practiced using Java,
Spring Boot, Kafka, and SQL, and built my backend development and distributed
systems skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on scalable system
design, data processing pipelines, and API-driven architectures, and I'm excited
to apply these skills on a backend engineering team at a company like
JPMorganChase.
